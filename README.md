ESPortal Credential Harvester  
-----  
  
A social engineering attack vector.  
Redirects HTTP requests to a fake login page. 
Does not support HTTPS requests nor does it override cached HTTPS redirects.  
You can define a custom template for up to 3 specific domains, a welcome portal, and a catch-all.  
  
Example scenario: Setup ESPortalV2 to act as a free WiFi hotspot.  
  
Captured credentials are stored on the exfiltration page in the file corresponding to the URL.  
  
Custom html templates can be uploaded for the ESPortal login credential harvester via FTP.  
If a custom html template is found it will override the default settings.  
Upon deletion the default settings are automatically restored.  
  
The filenames must match the below exactly in order to apply a template override.  
captiveportal.html     -     The catch all that handles the redirects.(Would be rare to override this part)  
welcome.html           -     The welcome page for the "free wifi" hotspot.  
spoof_other.html       -     The generic login credential harvester for a site not in the list.  
spoof_site1.html       -     The 1st login credential harvester site in the list with a custom layout.  
spoof_site2.html       -     The 2nd login credential harvester site in the list with a custom layout.  
spoof_site3.html       -     The 3rd login credential harvester site in the list with a custom layout.  
error.html             -     Display some sort of custom error when the user enters login credentials.  
  
NOTE: Modifying any ESPortal related setting requires a reboot of the ESPortal device.  
Do not leave any line blank or as a duplicate of another.
